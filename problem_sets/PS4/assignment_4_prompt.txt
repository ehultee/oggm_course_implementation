Select a city or region and write a memo to inform the local government about the risks 
their area faces due to glacier change.  In your memo, be sure to outline in clear language:

- what are the most important glacier-related risks for this location,
- what is the glaciological mechanism or process creating the risk,
- how can we expect the risk to evolve in the future with a changing climate, and
- how do we know (include citations as footnotes)
An excellent memo will also tailor the language to address what is most important to the 
area--culturally, economically, or demographically for example.

 

Possible choices of city or region could be:

- Santiago, Chile
- Ilulissat, Greenland
- Chamoli, Uttarakhand, India
- Courmayeur, Val d'Aosta, Italy
- South Tarawa, Kiribati
- Kasese, Uganda (Rwenzori Mountains National Park)
- Boston, Massachusetts, USA
- Another place of your choosing (even your hometown!)
