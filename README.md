# oggm_course_implementation
Documentation for the use of OGGM-Edu materials in an upper-level undergraduate course.  The example here is GEOL362 at Middlebury College, taught by Lizz Ultee.
The goal of this repository is to support instructors who would like to use OGGM to teach glacier modelling fundamentals.
The Jupyter notebooks and a Binder environment to launch them are found in [this operational repository](https://github.com/ehultee/glaciology-labs).

Here, to provide additional context on implementation, you will find 
- a syllabus (general course overview provided to students);
- course schedule of activities (used by instructor L. Ultee to structure what students did during each session and in between);
- lab prompts/procedures for non-OGGM activities run during the 3hr weekly lab session;
- lab prompts for Jupyter notebooks that run OGGM and OGGM-Edu helper functions;
- example student submissions, posted with permission and names redacted, for the 4 OGGM-based labs; and
- problem sets (as PDF and editable TeX format) assigned to students in alternating weeks.  Note that I do have typed solutions to the problem sets and will happily provide them to instructors.  They are omitted from this public repo to ensure the educational value of re-using the problem sets with future groups of students.

Please do get in touch anytime to discuss teaching with OGGM, or general glaciology teaching, in more detail!

Thanks are due to the entire [OGGM team](https://oggm.org/community/), especially Fabien Maussion, Timo Roth, Patrick Schmitt, Zora Schirmeister, and Daniel Frisinghelli.
