Lab 2, Modelling Glacier Mass Balance - lab report prompt - due 15 Oct 2021

Create a basic lab report by filling in the template.
The questions provided will outline where to focus your thinking.
Experiment 1 refers to Notebook 1, glacier_bed_slope.ipynb, from Tuesday lab.  
Experiment 2 refers to Notebook 2, mass_balance.ipynb, which we will work through on Thursday.
 
This lab report aims to prepare you for more formal lab reports later on.  It will require 
more self-directed writing than the previous one, for example in the Introduction and Methods 
sections, but does not yet require an abstract.  Everyone will receive full marks for the 
"Abstract" category of the rubric below.
